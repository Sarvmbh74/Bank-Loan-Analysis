# Bank-Loan-Analysis using Power BI & SQL

### Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) of the bank's lending portfolio, including total loan applications, total funded amounts, total amounts received, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income ratios. By monitoring Month-to-Date (MTD) metrics and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes, we seek to gain insights into loan performance, cash flow, and borrower financial health.

### Objective
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
